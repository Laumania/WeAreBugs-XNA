XNA port of the game "We Are Bugs" by Jeff Weber
http://www.farseergames.com/blog/2009/4/30/we-are-bugs-refactored-and-source-released.html

This project includes two version of "We Are Bugs".

BugsSL - A direct port of Jeff's browser Silverlight version to a Silverlight version that runs and works on Windows Phone.
BugsXNA - A XNA version of the game.

It's in the BugsXNA project that I have put the work. 
The goal is to keep the source(XNA) as close to the original(Silverlight) one, but still being true to how XNA do things.

I'll write more about this later when I'm done.

- Enjoy & stay tuned :)
