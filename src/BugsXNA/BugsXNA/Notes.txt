- XNA like float better than double, so alot of doubles have been made to floats.
- Almost all Update(dt) have been changed to Update(gameTime) as that's what XNA uses
- As XNA doesn't have "Views" in the same seperated way as Silverlight, I'm using the States 
as my "Views". This means that the Clicked event is on the states and not in the view.
Yeah I know, it's not pretty, but it were the best solution I could come up with 
while trying to stay as close as possible to the original source.
- The original states have been rewritten to "Screens". A Screen can be seens as a View+State if you think in the original Silverlight code
- I use the "Game State Management" sample from here: http://create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management
